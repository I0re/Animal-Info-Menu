# Animal-Info-Menu

This is a simple program that uses switch cases to create a menu of animals, and when an animal is pressed, it asks for the order associated with the animal and invokes the correct constructor and destructor for said animal. It also generates a random age for each animal within a specified age range, as well as some quick facts about their diets.
